# Utility-App

This is a personal project to hone my JavaScript skills. 
<br>It involves functions, arrays, loops, events, DOM updates, and string handling.

**Skills I learned:**
- Light Switch tool: 
<li>Changing css style based on an event listener
- Counter tool: 
<li>Using the value of an input element
<li>Converting the value to a number
<li>Incrementing and decrementing the value based on an event listener 
<li>Using function parameters to create conditions for code readability
- Quote Generator tool:
<li>Getting the index of a random item in an array
<li>Removing and outputting the random item from the original array 
<li>Loops don't work well with removing items from arrays due to changes in length
- Creating tabs:
<li>Hide all tab content by default in CSS and JS
<li>Create active-tab class for tab content that you want to show, in CSS and JS
<li>Use event listeners to only show the relevant active-tab
