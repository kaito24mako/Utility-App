# Utility-App

This is a personal project to hone my JavaScript skills. 
<br>It involves functions, arrays, loops, events, DOM updates, and string handling.

**Skills I learned:**
- Light Switch tool: 
<br>Changing css style based on an event listener.
- Counter tool: 
<br>Using the value of an input element.
<br>Converting the value to a number.
<br>Incrementing and decrementing the value based on an event listener.
<br>Using function parameters to create conditions for code readability.
- Quote Generator tool:
<br>Getting the index of a random item in an array.
<br>Removing and outputting the random item from the original array. 
<br>Loops don't work well with removing items from arrays due to changes in length.
- Creating tabs:
<br>Hide all tab content by default in CSS and JS.
<br>Create active-tab class for tab content that you want to show, in CSS and JS.
<br>Use event listeners to only show the relevant active-tab.
